Yesterday, I came across this post on BusinessWeek: [How to save this blog (or at least the posts)](http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2009/11/how_to_save_thi.html)

It's a problem I've faced many times: you need to save your old blog, or your old website, in a form that will be accessible i
n the future, and won't need any investment (in money or time from your part).

Some may say that the solution is to move your content to an open source content management system. I don't think so. You will have to keep up with the updates, new database versions, incompatibilities of future versions of the CMS with your current hosting environment etc. After a couple of years, you will realize that in order to keep up with the newest versions of the CMS you will have to upgrade your apache server, and then you will find out that you have to upgrade your linux distribution...

IMHO, the best format is static HTML pages. If you have a web server, you will be able to host them. And even if you don't you will be able to read them locally!

This is one of the main reasons I expect a lot from web publishing systems that create static pages in the first place: this content will most probably survive longer.
