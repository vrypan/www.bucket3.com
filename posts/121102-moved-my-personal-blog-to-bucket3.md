A couple of days ago, I finally moved [blog.vrypan.net](http://blog.vrypan.net/) to bucket3 (it was hosted on tumblr) and amazon s3.

I’m using a modified theme that will eventually make it to the source code of bucket3, but I’d like to work some more on it.

This is the second blog that runs on bucket3. The other one, is a linkblog, [picks.vrypan.net](http://picks.vrypan.net) that has been running for nearly a year now.
