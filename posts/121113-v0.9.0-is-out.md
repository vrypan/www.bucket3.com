Version 0.9.0 of bucket3 is out. Grab it on [github](https://github.com/vrypan/bucket3) or use pip

    pip install bucket3
    
0.9.0 brings major changes to the CLI. If you are starting a new blog, install bucket3 and do something like this:

create a directory where all your blog files will go.

    $ mkdir myblog
    
initialize bucket3.

    $ cd myblog; bucket3 init

edit .bucket3/conf.yaml according to your preferences and your setup (domain name, URL, etc)
    
Create a new, empty post file.

    $ cd posts 
    $ bucket3 new hello-world-1

Edit the file generated, and add some text. Save it.
    
Render your blog’s HTML!

    $ bucket3 2html
    
You should now have your whole blog under  “html" (as defined in your conf file). Upload the files to your server. 

Repeat the last steps (from _”bucket3 new ...”_) to create more posts, and upload.
